Prime Game Project

Description

This project involves implementing a game between two players, Maria and Ben, who take turns choosing a prime number from a set of consecutive integers and removing that number and its multiples. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. The goal is to determine the winner of the game after multiple rounds, assuming both players play optimally.

Game Rules

The game is played with a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n.

Players take turns choosing a prime number from the set.

Once a prime number is chosen, that number and all its multiples are removed from the set.

The player who cannot make a move loses the game.
