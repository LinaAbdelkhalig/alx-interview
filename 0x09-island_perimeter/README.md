Island Perimeter

Description

This project involves creating a Python function island_perimeter that calculates the perimeter of an island described in a grid. The grid is a 2D list of integers where:

0 represents water

1 represents land

The function adheres to the following rules:

Each cell is square, with a side length of 1.

Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).

The grid is completely surrounded by water.

There is only one island (or none).

The island does not have lakes (water inside the island that is not connected to the water surrounding it).
